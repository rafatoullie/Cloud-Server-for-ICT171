# Overview
I have chosen to make a blog page using wordpress for my project, I will also be including a script that backs up the data for my page everyday.




# Installing Wordpress
Since we have been asked to build this on top of the server we launched for the previous assignment. I will skip documenting the process of starting the web server as this has been assumed to be complete already. The type of instance I am using is a t2.micro instance
from AWS EC2.
Thus, for our first step we must install Wordpress, but before we install Wordpress we need to install a few prerequisites such as Apache, MySQL to set up a database and PHP since Wordpress is built using it.

- APACHE
